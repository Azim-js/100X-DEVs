# Why languages?

Interpreted vs compiled languages
Why JS >> Other languages in some use-cases
Strict vs dynamic languages
Single threaded nature of JS
Simple primitives in JS (number, strings, booleans)
Complex primitives in JS (arrays, objects)
Functions in Javascript
Practise problem solving
Callback functions, Event loop, callback queue, Asynchronous programming
Callback hell and Promises

# DAY 3

Variables (let, var, const)
Data types - strings, numbers and booleans
If/else
Loops - For loop
Let’s write some code -
1. Write the program to greet a person given their first and last name
2. Write a program that greets a person based on their gender. (If else)
3. Write a program that counts from 0 - 1000 and prints (for loop)

# Day 4 

1. Arrays
2. Objects
Let’s write some code -
1. Write a program prints all the even numbers in an array
2. Write a program to print the biggest number in an arrya
3. Write a program that prints all the male people’s first name given a complex object
4. Write a program that reverses all the elements of an array


# Day 5 

Functions let you
1. Abstract out logic in your program
2. Take arguments as an input
3. Return a value as an output
4. You can think of them as an independent program that is supposed to do something
 given an input
5. Functions CAN take other functions as input - this will confuse you (callbacks)
Let’s write some code -
1. Write a function that finds the sum of two numbers
2. Write another function that displays this result in a pretty format
3. Write another function that takes this sum and prints it in passive tense

# Synchronous 

All the code we’ve written until now
All code running line by line (hence sync)


# Asynchronous
Asynchronous functions in programming are those
that allow a program to start a potentially longrunning operation and continue executing other
tasks without waiting for that operation to
complete. This is particularly important in
environments like web browsers or Node.js, where
waiting for an operation to finish (like fetching
data from a server or reading a large file) could
make the application unresponsive.

# Async functions vs sync functions, real use of callbacks
JS Browser architecture
Promises
Async await
